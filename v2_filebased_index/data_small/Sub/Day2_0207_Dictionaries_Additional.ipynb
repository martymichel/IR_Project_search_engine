    "The python programming language natively implements a number of data structures. Lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries are but some of them. We will be looking at the dictionary data type in subsequent sections.\n",

    "\n",
    "A dictionary in python is a mapping object that maps keys to values, where the keys are unique within a collection and the values can hold any arbitrary value. In addition to being unique, keys are also required to be hashable. An object is said to be hashable if it has a hash value (implemented by a `__hash__()` method) that does not change during the object’s lifetime. Most commonly, we use immutable data types such as strings, integers, and tuples (only if they contain similarly immutable types) as dictionary keys. A dictionary’s data is always enclosed by a pair of curly braces `{ }`.\n",

    "### Comparisons\n",
    "Dictionaries are an implementation of [Associative Arrays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array). All Associative arrays have a structure of (key, value) pairs, where each key is unique for every collection. Other languages also have similar executions, such as:\n",
    "- Maps in Go\n",
    "- std::map in C++\n",
    "- Maps in Java\n",
    "- JavaScript objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike sequenced data types like lists and tuples, where indexing is achieved using positional indices, dictionaries are indexed using their keys. Therefore, individual values can be accessed using these keys. \n",
    "Typically dictionaries store associative data, i.e data that is related. Examples of such data include the attributes of an object, `SQL` query results and csv-formatted information. Throughout this article, we will be using dictionaries to store job listing details from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ardenn/brighter-monday-job-listings/data).\n",

What if we want to go even further, and return something, a placeholder of sorts? `get()` takes a second argument, a default value to be used in place of `None`. Now Let's use `in` to check if `title` exists in `job2`, then we can use indexing to retrieve its value. We'll also go ahead and use `get()` to retrieve `salary` from `job2`."

    "Dictionaries come in very handy for regular python usage. They are suitable for use with unordered data that relies on relations. Caution should however be exercised to ensure we do not use dictionaries in the wrong way and end up slowing down execution of our code. For further reading please refer to the official python documentation on [mapping types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesmapping)."
